# Token Sale
The token sale section allows users to run simple token sales with a fixed price, for their own sUDT.

## Create a token sale
The owner of an sUDT can create a token sale for their own sUDT.
Fill in the token supply to sell, and price per token in CKB.

The tokens will be minted within the same transaction.


## Participate in a token sale
Users can search for a token sale using the lock hash of the sUDT owner. The lock hash is kept in the URL, so anyone can link to a given sale.
Anyone with sufficient CKBytes can trade for a corresponding value of the sUDT.
